StuffControl
============

**StuffControll** is yet another Getting-Things-Done organiser accessible via browser or as mobile app. The idea to create it was born from absence of good *open source* GTD-style organiser for Android. And I was desperately need it. The simple thing I can trust on and which allows me to control my data entirely.
